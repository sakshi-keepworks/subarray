# Largest sum contiguous subarray

A Ruby program to find the contiguous subarray within a onedimensional array of
numbers (containing at least one positive number) which has the largest sum. For example,

for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the
largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6.

The program runs as follows:

Enter the array : 2

1 3

4 1

2 1 5
